# Reddit Oldify
A Chrome extension to automatically go back to the good 'n old reddit design that we all loved
## How it works?
This is a simple redirector ( or *_redditrector_* if you like) script which will redirect you  to https: //old.reddit. ...  whenever you land on Reddit, saving you the time and effort of writting old.reddit. ... prefix manually.
This is motivated due to Reddit not longer preserving my preferences  and automatically loading it's  new design by default on each page load, instead of automatically directing me to an old.reddit.. url as it used to do before.

This is a tool  to empower the users to have the design they like , whenever they like, without being tied to the tirany of Material Design, even if Reddit changes their policy and start trying to feed-force it to you.

3. Select the unzipped folder of the extension's repo that you just downloaded.It should appear then among your extensions.
4. Enjoy 

**A note for Windows users** Unfortunatelly , Chrome believes that Windows users are noobs  so they'll keep reminding you to *disable Developer Mode to be safe* on an annoying bubble. This doesn't happens on Linux or Mac apparently. There [is a way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577024/install-chrome-extension-not-in-the-store) to avoid this, but you have to download a special Chrome for Devs. (which I recommend you  if you're a dev). Please don't disable the Developer Mode to keep the extension working

>I promess you I'll defeat the lazyness and upload it to the official Google's Store soon
